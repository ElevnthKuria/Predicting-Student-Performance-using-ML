## Project Details:

Project Name: Students Performance

Project Description: This project aims to predict the performance of students based on their academic and non-academic attributes. The project will use a machine learning algorithm to train a model that can predict the performance of students based on their attributes.

The data source for this project is a dataset of student performance data. The dataset contains information about the students' academic and non-academic attributes, as well as their performance in various subjects. _Link:_ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance

## Project Goals:

1. To build a machine learning model that can predict the performance of students based on their attributes.
2. To evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
3. To optimize the model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters.

## Project Tasks:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features from the existing ones.
   - Select the most relevant features for the prediction task.

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the prediction task.
   - Train the model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

4. Model Evaluation and Optimization:
   - Calculate various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.
   - Compare the performance of the tuned model with the original model.

5. Model Deployment:
   - Deploy the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
